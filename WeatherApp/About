This machine is vulnerable to HTTP request Splitting Via SSRF. it also exploits the /register path 
which vulnerable to SQLi to change the password of the Admin user. So this scripts creates the request
to the /api/weather path and then using the endpoint parameter which is vulnerable to SSRF it sends another request(HTTP Request splitting) 
to the /register path, in this request the password parameter is an SQLi payload that changes the password of the user.
